This multiplayer card game project is designed for 2 to 6 players. The objective is to win battles and reach level 10. The game features a new set of cards for each player.

At the beginning of the game, each player chooses a character type they want to play. In each round, every player draws a card from the deck and plays it. The card played can either benefit the player by increasing their life points, currency, and levels, or it can be used to attack other players, reducing their life points or resetting them to zero.

The game continues in rounds until a player reaches level 10 or their life points reach zero, at which point the game ends. Whether a player wins or loses, the game concludes, and the results are displayed.
